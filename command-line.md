Questions:

1. How would I describe a terminal to a layperson?

I would describe it as a tool where the user is at a central space where all important information, can be reached or manipulated using a set of commands without having to leave that central space.

2. List 10 commands

ls

Loads a list of files in the current directory that you are in.

git clone <GITHUB_REPO>

Makes a copy (or a clone) of a repository from the internet and stores it on the computer hard-drive where it can be manipulated offline and without overwriting the repository that is stored online.

git add <filename/filename.md>

This command will get the chosen file ready to be uploaded to your github repository, but won't do anything until the file is commited.

git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE_HERE"

This command will take any staged files and commit them to github.

git pull origin master

Similar to cloning, but instead the terminal will retrieve the lastest version of the repository.

git push origin master

This command will update the repository with the files that the user had initially staged and committed.

cd </~workspace/>

The cd command allows the user to navigate through folders in your hard-drive, without using your os explorer.

git status

This command allows the user to check the status of what has been staged and what hasn't. Very useful when checking what files were staged before you commit and push them to github.

rm

This command allows the user to remove a file from the reposity.

git help

This command will show all available commands that the user can utilize with git
